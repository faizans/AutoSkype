Skype Automation on OSX

This little tool will allow you to set up a white list of callers whose calls get accepted automatically.

There is an option that allows you enable your video or not.

Setup
=====

Clone the repository
Rename the `desired_callers.txt.sample` to `desired_callers.txt`.
Enter some Skype ID's _one ID per line_ in the newly renamed file.
Export the Script as an Application and run it.

Enjoy!
