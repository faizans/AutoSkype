Automatically answer Skype calls from your peers.

This little tool will allow you to set up a white list of callers whose calls will be accepted automatically. It can even be configured to open a video conference at the same time.

Setup
=====

Clone the repository
Rename the `desired_callers.txt.sample` to `desired_callers.txt`.
Enter some Skype ID's _one ID per line_ in the newly renamed file.

Run `make` on the console to build the bundle.

Run the newly generataed AutoSkype.app file and you're good to go!
